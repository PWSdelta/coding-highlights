# KC‚Äôs Code & Tools Spotlight

Welcome to the curated highlight reel of my programming playground. Below you‚Äôll find my most meaningful repos and a few fan-favorite Gists that capture my style: practical, messy, and occasionally, *brilliant*.

## üîß Featured Projects

### [README-Styleguide.md](https://github.com/PWSdelta/README-Styleguide.md)  
*I literally wrote a README writing guide*  
Because apparently, writing good READMEs matters to me more than I realized. Handy if you want a dose of sarcastic yet practical documentation advice.

---

### [asin](https://github.com/PWSdelta/asin)  
*A Ruby gem I cloned and customized*  
Forked and enhanced this gem to fit my specific needs. Great example of diving into someone else‚Äôs codebase, fixing bugs, and adding features without losing sanity.

---

### [RubyScripts](https://github.com/PWSdelta/RubyScripts)  
*My personal goldmine of Ruby tinkering*  
A collection of small scripts, experiments, and utilities I wrote over time while learning and automating tasks. Expect lots of practical hacks and proof-of-concept snippets.

---

### [dotfiles](https://github.com/PWSdelta/dotfiles)  
*Configuring a Linux dev environment*  
Personal dotfiles for bash/zsh, vim, tmux, and other tools. Shows how I set up and optimize my working shell environment.

## üåü Popular Gists

### [Ruby Model Testing Template](https://gist.github.com/PWSdelta/6234923)  
Over 800 stars and counting ‚Äî a comprehensive testing scaffold for Ruby models. This template has helped hundreds of developers write better tests faster, even inspired a blog post roasting me for it (all in good fun).

### [Capistrano Deployment Script](https://gist.github.com/PWSdelta/8033206)  
An overengineered Capistrano script I built to handle full-stack app deployment. DevOps-heavy, a little chaotic, but it reliably shipped code. Great look at my approach to deployment automation back then.
