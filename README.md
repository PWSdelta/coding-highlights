# Code & Tools Spotlight

Welcome to the curated highlight reel of my programming playground. Below you‚Äôll find my most meaningful repos and a few fan-favorite Gists that capture my style: practical, messy, and occasionally brilliant.
üîß Featured Projects
asin

A Ruby gem I cloned and customized
Forked and enhanced this gem to fit my specific needs. Great example of diving into someone else‚Äôs codebase, fixing bugs, and adding features without losing sanity.
RubyScripts

My personal goldmine of Ruby tinkering
A collection of small scripts, experiments, and utilities I wrote over time while learning and automating tasks. Expect lots of practical hacks and proof-of-concept snippets.
README-Styleguide.md

I literally wrote a README writing guide
Because apparently, writing good READMEs matters to me more than I realized. Handy if you want a dose of sarcastic yet practical documentation advice.
dotfiles

Configuring a Linux dev environment
Personal dotfiles for bash/zsh, vim, tmux, and other tools. Shows how I set up and optimize my working shell environment.
üåü Popular Gist
Ruby Model Testing Template

Over 800 stars and counting ‚Äî a comprehensive testing scaffold for Ruby models. This template has helped hundreds of developers write better tests faster, even inspired a blog post roasting me for it (all in good fun).
